# ReactTest

Technical test

## LAUNCHER

To launch the project locally, you must follow the different instructions:

```
npm install
```

This will install the project with all its dependencies on our pc

```
npm run server
```

This command will allow us to launch the mock server, starting from **JSON-server**.
We will launch it in port **3001** since port 3000 will be occupied by our project later

```
npm run start
```

Finally this command will allow us to launch the application by automatically opening a tab
